# expensesCalculation

This project provides a code for a budget management application. The application allows users to input their budget, add expenses, remove them and dynamically update the remaining budget.

- User Budget: The user sets an initial budget.
- Expense Tracking: The user can add expenses and the remaining balance is updated automatically.
- Expense Removal: Expenses can be deleted, and the balance updates accordingly.
- Alerts: Displays success/error messages for actions.
- UI Feedback: The color of the remaining balance changes based on the budget (green, yellow, or red).
- The app also disables the "Add Expense" button if the budget is exhausted.
